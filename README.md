# [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/) integration plugin for [Playnite](https://playnite.link/)

Enables Playnite to import and launch Minecraft instances made using ATLauncher as if they were individual games. 
This is still a work in progress and will continue to be improved

## Installation

Download the latest .pext file from releases and open it using Playnite

## Usage

Open addon settings in Playnite and navigate to ATLauncher. Set the path to the directory containing ATLauncher.exe and the instances folder.

The two checkboxes control if the ATLauncher console will be shown and if ATLauncher will close itself after launcher an instance.
